* There are four major parts to this project:
   * 1.) Development of a mobile game
   * 2.) Integration of tools to measure KPIs
   * 3.) Launch and user acquisition
   * 4.) Marketing dashboard

### Game Design

* The purpose of my project is not making a AAA game; this is a means to the end for the marketing analytics part.
* Regardless, my game must be compelling _enough_ that a user would:
   * 1.) Play for more than a few minutes
   * 2.) Reach a conversion goal, e.g. watch an advertisement
* To bypass lengthy design and planning, I am replicating a genre that would be managable for me to solely develop: A 2D, menu-driven, clicker/incremental game.

### Monetization

#### Monetization: Advertisements

* **My conversion goal is that a user get all the way to watching at least one advertisement**.
* I am using Google AdMob to deliver video-based advertisements in exchange for in-game rewards.

#### Monetization: In-App Purchases

* I will set up this framework in my app, but it is more of an academic exercise than a monetization goal.

### Marketing Analytics Hooks

* There are a few KPI's that I am keeping track of:
   * Android device ID, this is unique to each device
   * Session length/count
   * Session time until conversion

### Pre-Launch Testing

#### Alpha Testing

* Specific implementations were privately tested on several Android devices.

#### Beta Testing

* Builds in which a user could make it to endgame (level 80) will be tested by a small group of experienced mobile gaming players.
* Beta testing was through Google Play Store testing framework.

### Required Legal Stuff for Google Play Store

***<center>I am not a lawyer and am not providing any legal advice here.</center>***

* In order to collect _any_ user data from an app on the Google Play Store, **you must provide a user agreement**.
* It is your responsibility to protect any user information you collect for marketing analytics, etc.

### Customer Service

* If customer issues come up, you need to handle them appropriately before too many bad reviews sink your app.

### Mobile App Marketing Primer

#### Introduction

* Every project will have different goals. These goals will define what marketing analytics are important to track as key performance indicators (KPIs).
* An example of a critical KPI that would guide high-level strategic decisions is user retention. This is an indicator of an app's success and is represented by _n_% user retention after _m_ days.

#### Terminology

* The following are popular terms in the mobile application marketing space:

Term | Description
--- | ---

#### Experimental Design

* Marketing and analytics are serious business; there are people that work on just these aspects of a mobile app full-time.
* From my experience in biotech analytics, be prepared for projects ranging from "We need to know _xyz_ by today" to multi-year sagas.
* This article provides an excellent overview of experimental design in analytics projects: https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/experimental-design-in-r/introduction-to-experimental-design?ex=1
